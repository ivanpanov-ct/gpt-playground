First task to accomplish is the following one: Task 1: The target audience for each store is different, so you would like to use different product names per store to increase sales. Your task is to ensure the product has different product names per store: In store Numero Uno (store key: numero-uno), the Product name for that product should be NAVY/OLD GOLD Men's Polo T-Shirt in (EN) locale instead. The head of marketing has approved it so you can make it visible in the store directly during creation. In store Acme, the Product name for that product should be the same as default in both locales
